# Supply-Chain Security

This repo follows the [`npm-supply-chain-defense`](https://github.com/thoughtform-co/npm-supply-chain-defense) skill (installed locally at `~/.cursor/skills/npm-supply-chain-defense` and `~/.claude/skills/npm-supply-chain-defense`).

## Baseline

- Baseline: **B (npm)**
- Cooldown: `minimum-release-age=10080` minutes (7 days)
- Lifecycle scripts: `ignore-scripts=true` (or `ignoreScripts = true` for Bun)
- Git dependencies: `allow-git=none` (npm only; pnpm/Yarn/Bun enforced via lockfile review)
- Migration to pnpm@11 is recommended but **deferred**: pinning `packageManager` and running `pnpm install` should happen in a supervised step after the cooldown is verified.

## Approved lifecycle scripts

| Package      | Reason                                      | How to run                                              |
| ------------ | ------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- |
| _(none yet)_ | _document here when an exception is needed_ | `npm rebuild --force <pkg>` after the safe install step |

## Exceptions

| Setting  | Value | Reason | Owner | Expiry |
| -------- | ----- | ------ | ----- | ------ |
| _(none)_ |       |        |       |        |
