# Rule: The through-line (`#voidwalker`)

The career timeline after the bio — nine beats on one gold spine, six of
them with a drawn wireframe plate — and the OPAQUE COVER that ends the
corridor ambient hold. "Voidwalker" is the station's title by owner
decision (2026-08-23); `.voidwalker*` is the `#about` bio's CSS block and is
never written here — this section is `.vw*` / `.vw-wire*`.

**Read first**

- [ADR-074: The through-line](../sentinel/decisions/074-voidwalker-through-line.md)
- [ADR-047](../sentinel/decisions/047-about-deck-flip-stage.md) (the station before it, whose exit relies on this one's top) · [ADR-056](../sentinel/decisions/056-services-proof-casefile.md) (the cover role's previous holder) · [ADR-068](../sentinel/decisions/068-casefile-glyphed-index-and-tool-dossier.md) (the wireframe grammar this forks) · [ADR-059](../sentinel/decisions/059-rail-instruments.md) (the journey mark, and the telemetry the right guard clears)

## Contracts

- **The cover lockstep.** `useCorridorExitScroll`'s `nextStation` query and
  `home-v2.css`'s `html[data-corridor-exit="true"] #voidwalker` rule name
  the SAME station; the ambient bottom gate and the fade envelope read the
  SAME rect (ADR-030 §6, recorded four times now). The station is plain
  flow, opaque, with NO negative `margin-top` and no shield var — `#about`'s
  slide-out exit lands on this station's top edge.
- **Three parse-option copies move together**: `app/(marketing)/page.tsx`
  (`CORRIDOR_RELOCATED_STATIONS`, `[voidwalker, about, services]`),
  `tests/lib/rail-manifest.test.ts` and `tests/lib/v7-parse.test.ts`. The
  drift guard is the alarm. `data-station` = `id` = manifest `targetId`.
- **The record is zero-import** (`lib/voidwalker/voidwalkerData.ts`) and its
  facts are at LOCK — `tests/lib/voidwalker-data.test.ts` pins the sourced
  phrasings and bans rounding, currency and model families. A copy change
  is a record edit plus that test. `#practice` is an EMPTY station in
  production; the foot may not point there.
- **A drawing declares what it letters** (`voidwalkerWireLabels.ts`) and
  `voidwalker-wire-markup` walks the rendered text against it: ≤8 labels,
  no digit, no currency, no `<img>`, exactly one `[data-gold]`, ≤50
  elements. Adding a label means adding it to the table in the same commit.
- **The `--w-*` token block on `.vw-wire__in` is the casefile's VERBATIM**,
  and theme.css re-derives both hosts from ONE light rule
  (`voidwalker-wire-tokens`). A new token lands in `casefile.css`,
  `voidwalker-wire.css` and `theme.css` in one commit — or in none.
- **One writer.** `useVoidwalkerScroll` owns `data-vw-ready`, `data-vw-beat`,
  `--vw-p`, per-beat `--vw-b` and the masthead's decode runs. No `<html>`
  writes, no store writes, no per-frame layout reads (the offset chain is
  cached; a `ResizeObserver` on the section AND on `document.body` refreshes
  it). Per-beat channels are hosted on the beat, never the root.
- **The rest state is the finished page.** The motion block is gated on
  `.vw[data-vw-ready]`; absent = every panel lit, the spine drawn, the
  diamonds filled. The hook's only gate is `prefers-reduced-motion:
no-preference` — ⚠ if a width gate is ever added, the CSS rest block in
  `voidwalker.css` takes the SAME pair.
- **The masthead never moves or fades** — it types in and un-types out, in
  place (the caption kernel; each lede run its own target so the gold `em`
  survives). Panels power on through the `--ci-off` ladder; the title's
  words brighten on `--vw-w`; all reversible.
- **The beats ALTERNATE around a centred spine at ≥1280** (ADR-074 U1):
  odd beats left (right-aligned, plate seated at the lane), even beats
  right. Below 1280 the `:nth-child(odd)` rules are reset and every beat
  reads off a left-hand spine — keep that reset when touching either block.
- ⚠ **Grid rows are EXPLICIT** on the spine (2/4), the beats list (2) and
  the foot (3): auto-placement slid the list under the spine's span and the
  spine measured 0px. ⚠ **The right guard** (`--vw-guard`, 32px below
  1600px) keeps a full paragraph off the right-rail telemetry; the band's
  edge sits 10–22px inside the readouts at the laptop widths.
- ⚠ **On the phone band the FRAME carries the plate's aspect, not the
  plate** — a wrapped headline in the bar otherwise eats the drawing.

## Verifying

`npx vitest run tests/lib/voidwalker-*.test.ts` for the record, the clock,
the drawings and the tokens; `node scripts/capture-voidwalker.mjs --vp
1440x800 [--theme light]` (headed) for the seam, the masthead, every beat at
its reading line, the reversal and the six plates measured; the ring smoke's
"ambient hold survives" case for the cover.
