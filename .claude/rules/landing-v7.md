# Rule: Landing v7

When editing files under `components/landing/v7/**` or `app/(marketing)/**`, you are in a **layered composite** (fixed gateway, sticky hero, opaque stations) — not a flat page.

**Read first**

- [ADR-008: Landing v7 background layers](../sentinel/decisions/008-landing-v7-background-layers.md)
- [ADR-010: Brandmark choreography](../sentinel/decisions/010-brandmark-choreography.md)
- [ADR-030: Tools viewscreen + edge bus](../sentinel/decisions/030-tools-section-cover-stack.md)
- [ADR-031: Rail Manifest](../sentinel/decisions/031-rail-manifest.md)

- Skill: `.claude/skills/brandmark-choreography/SKILL.md`

**LandingPage must stay render-stable.** It owns the
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prototype body, and `ServicesPortal` /
`BuildCasesPortal` mount nested `createRoot`s into placeholder nodes
inside that markup. A LandingPage re-render that re-applies the
innerHTML orphans those nested roots (cards silently vanish, no error).
Do NOT add `useAuth` or other post-mount-updating subscriptions to
LandingPage — push them into leaf components (see `CelestialEditorGate`).
Ref: BEST-PRACTICES "Nested-root portals".

**Tools geometry is one CSS-owned contract.** The fixed header, sticky
deck, and right-rail register share the exact 1101×760 + motion-allowed
capability. Do not reintroduce a JS pixel table, floating service pills,
or a stack-local progress rail. Preserve the `--tools-bg-in` shield and
opaque-before-ambient-retirement ordering from ADR-030.

**The left-rail manifest is parse-injected (ADR-031).** Its skeleton is
built at parse time (`lib/v7-parse/railManifest.ts`) into the authored
`<nav data-rail-manifest-root>` shell; `RailManifestController` mutates
it in place. Never `createRoot` into `[data-rail-manifest-root]` (it
clobbers the server skeleton); keep the shell markup in the prototype
HTML byte-exact (the parse regex + `tests/lib/rail-manifest.test.ts`
pin it); journey order lives in `lib/rail-manifest/entries.ts` under a
drift-guard test. Seat motion is quantized `steps()` keyed to the same
`data-active-station` flip as the header type-on and register handover
— no FLIP flights (retired, ADR-030 Updates 1–3).

**Process**

- Before non-trivial changes: [sentinel/MAINTENANCE.md](../sentinel/MAINTENANCE.md) (Cycle B if adding a section; Cycle A after fixes).
- After any non-trivial fix: same file, Cycle A checklist.
