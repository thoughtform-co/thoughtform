# Rule: Landing v7

When editing files under `components/landing/v7/**` or `app/(marketing)/**`, you are in a **layered composite** (fixed gateway, sticky hero, opaque stations) — not a flat page.

**Read first**

- [ADR-010: Brandmark choreography](../sentinel/decisions/010-brandmark-choreography.md)

**LandingPage must stay render-stable.** It owns the
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prototype body, and `ServicesPortal` /
`BuildCasesPortal` mount nested `createRoot`s into placeholder nodes
inside that markup. A LandingPage re-render that re-applies the
innerHTML orphans those nested roots (cards silently vanish, no error).
Do NOT add `useAuth` or other post-mount-updating subscriptions to
LandingPage — push them into leaf components (see `CelestialEditorGate`).
Ref: BEST-PRACTICES "Nested-root portals".

**Tools geometry is one CSS-owned contract.** The fixed header, sticky
deck, and right-rail register share the exact 1101×760 + motion-allowed
capability. Do not reintroduce a JS pixel table, floating service pills,
or a stack-local progress rail. Preserve the `--tools-bg-in` shield and
opaque-before-ambient-retirement ordering from ADR-030.

**Process**

- Before non-trivial changes: [sentinel/MAINTENANCE.md](../sentinel/MAINTENANCE.md) (Cycle B if adding a section; Cycle A after fixes).
- After any non-trivial fix: same file, Cycle A checklist.
