# Rule: Landing v7

When editing files under `components/landing/v7/**` or `app/(marketing)/**`, you are in a **layered composite** (fixed gateway, sticky hero, opaque stations) — not a flat page.

**Read first**

- [ADR-008: Landing v7 background layers](../sentinel/decisions/008-landing-v7-background-layers.md)
- [ADR-010: Brandmark choreography](../sentinel/decisions/010-brandmark-choreography.md)
- Skill: `.claude/skills/landing-v7-compositing/SKILL.md`
- Skill: `.claude/skills/brandmark-choreography/SKILL.md`

**LandingPage must stay render-stable.** It owns the
`dangerouslySetInnerHTML` prototype body, and `ServicesPortal` /
`BuildCasesPortal` mount nested `createRoot`s into placeholder nodes
inside that markup. A LandingPage re-render that re-applies the
innerHTML orphans those nested roots (cards silently vanish, no error).
Do NOT add `useAuth` or other post-mount-updating subscriptions to
LandingPage — push them into leaf components (see `CelestialEditorGate`).

**Process**

- Before non-trivial changes: [sentinel/MAINTENANCE.md](../sentinel/MAINTENANCE.md) (Cycle B if adding a section; Cycle A after fixes).
- After any non-trivial fix: same file, Cycle A checklist.
