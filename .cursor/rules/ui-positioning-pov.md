## UI positioning POV (Viewer)

When I say **top-left / top-right / bottom-left / bottom-right**, interpret it from the **viewer’s POV on the screen** (standard screen coordinates), **not** a mirrored or transformed coordinate space.

- **Top-left**: upper-left corner of the viewport as the user sees it
- **Top-right**: upper-right corner of the viewport as the user sees it
- **Bottom-left**: lower-left corner of the viewport as the user sees it
- **Bottom-right**: lower-right corner of the viewport as the user sees it
